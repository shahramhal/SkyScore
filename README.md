# SkyScore

SkyScore is a web-based application designed to streamline the "Health Check" technique used by SKY's Engineering Department to assess the operational health of their engineering teams. Inspired by Spotify's Squad Health Check model, this application replaces the traditional spreadsheet method with a dynamic, user-friendly interface that reduces data entry errors and improves data accessibility.
